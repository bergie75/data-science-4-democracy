All the code I wrote while working on vaccine hesitancy at Johns Hopkins' Agora Institute's inaugural Data Science For Democracy Workshop.

This code was designed to predict the level of vaccine uptake in U.S. counties. Both random forest and generalized logistic regression were attempted in order to model the underlying relationships. The files random_forest.py and general_multi_regression.py contain the code used to train the models. The remaining files were used for exploratory data analysis and comparing large numbers of trained models to understand the range of predictions such models could make.
